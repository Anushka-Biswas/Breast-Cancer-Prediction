# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
The project aims to predict Breast Cancer using K Nearest Neighbor in Java, using Euclidean distance as the distance metric to calculate the distance between the new data point and all other data points in the dataset. 

The project aims to classify the tumor as malignant or benign. 

I would like to throw some light on some of the following key points: 

Tumor V/s Cancer: 

A tumor refers to an abnormal mass or growth of cells in the body. Benign tumors are non-cancerous and typically do not spread to other parts of the body. They are usually localized and do not invade nearby tissue.

Conversely, cancer refers to a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. These cells can form malignant tumors, which invade surrounding tissues and spread to other body parts.

So, while all cancers involve the presence of tumors, not all tumors are cancerous.
